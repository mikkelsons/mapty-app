# Mapty Project

An exercise tracking app using asynchronous JavaScript calls to a map API and object-oriented programming. This application was coded as the final project of the Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!" taught by Jonas Schmedtmann.

I do not claim any ownership of the html or css. That was provided to me by the instructor. I coded the JavaScript.
